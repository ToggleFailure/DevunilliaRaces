    "Kybins a creature that shoud not exist, They are a cold blooded mammal living in a place that can get over a hundred bellow zero in the winter and supports next to no plant life."," I will go over their habitat first they live in a extreme altitude on top of plateus that are over 4 mile tall spanning 200 miles across in one direction"," and 1000 miles in another. In terms of plants they have exactly 10 species of plant with the 5 of 10 plants being toxic to everything exept a few species of herbivore","3 out of 10 being edible to everything exept kybins such as the Absom Tomo and its cusin the Deh Vilsha"," and the remaining 2 are one of the only plant in the known universe a kybin can eat and not get sick","all species of Carvitan and Subomalin making up a total of 4 fruits they can eat.","A total of 5 species of animal live here most of them with the exeption of the kybin, Kylevsorian and The Btsimolic mature in about 1 week to 1 year.","We cover by survivabillity, The Farvette fammily is a group of mostly small and harmless herbivore","that looks like a giant hairy ant if it is orange run and run fast thats a Velvete Farvette"," weighing just about 10 pounds and they have a softish exoskeleton so once you catch them blugeon them with a rod now","The Grilde its actualy quite harmless as long as its bean defanged, it produces alcoholic milk with a antifreeze proteins in it"," simmillar to a Kybins blood, the milk is quite good for a lot of things including medicine"," Now why are these the Kybin farm animal higher then a Farvette they have a venomous bite with the antidote a Death rock also being deadly to kybins.","The Btsimolic is about like a honey badger they are twice the size of a polar bear and are almost impossible to kill by ones self they are hunted twice every 8 years as they take about 5 years to mature","I could not find them in the wild so i when granted an audiance with their leader got this in responce","A 500 page essay on why you should not kill them and why they are the best alien dogs in the whole univers","The summary is as follows","Ah yes any true kybin know what a Kylevsorian is they are our cute giant puffballs of death and destruction"," weighing over 700 pounds and being quite literaly one of the most naturaly armored animals on the planet with a tail that shoots spike"," faster then a most shotguns we have and canines well over 9 inchs in length","there is nothing about this animal not to love they never maim their owner","and this is the scientific facts about it, While the most dangerous animal on our lands they are litteraly just like dogs they crave attention and have a very possitve attitude","They alays pick a owner on their own and for every Kybin born there is one Kylevsorian","We believe that the reason for this is that a Kylevsorian will not mature untill it meets its master ","and while they often cant leave our planet do to their size they can be summoned ussing a tactical coller and ridden into battle","The last species is kybin they age like a turtle after a certain point their organs stop aging, they happened to thrive by against all odds and their is countlse amounts of study to be done on them","They have a special type of protein in their blood consisting of 5 percent helium and 95 percent nitrogen that in total makes up 10 percent of their bodily fluids","However it should be noted that they are cold blooded and as a result in tempuraatues below -200 farenheit they will perish within minutes","they as well do not do well in temperature above 130 as the helium in there blood becomes extremely agitated","What they eat as previously stated is mostly meat while the Subomalin and Carvitan are edible they are kinda rare as for the meat if it has stopped moving its edible","they can cooked food as well some other fruit like apples but never give them melon or pineapple it makes them sicker then Deh Vilsha."
