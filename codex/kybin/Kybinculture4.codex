    "K1 Shotgun despite being a millitary coded weapons is used by civillians as well it was made in the kybin year 2479 almost one hundred years before the two planets the kybin inhabited went to war was made so that you could more easily hit the thing in front of you.","K1-2 Shotgun is a improved k1 shotgun with a laser sight and made to be easy to fire as well as smak things can doe al the K1 SG can and more.","K2 Smart Device gun(not yet coded) or K2SDSG or as the troops called it Hit and Jam is a shot gun developed by the WDC president Alice Piat shoots special bullets that home in on target effective range is unown as of yet was only used for a short time.","K3 Auto Shotgun, Its a machine gun and a shotgun its perfect it also shoots some pretty neet stuff depending on the model developed in joint by General George and Mathew Vak of the WDC.","The AntiTank Shotgun have you ever shot 4 20mm plus round from an average sized Shotgun at once or the better question is would you want to it this is the reason why a responsible adult must always be with General Geoge normaly its his wife","we are not even sure how this gun works and we watched him make the dang thing.","K1 Automatic Rifle is to Kybins what the m1 was to americans in the war it was reliable it was tough and push come to shove use it like a club was made near the begining of the Kybian war.","k1-2 Automatic Rifle Like all thing if it can be made better do so this realy only made it harder to breakbut it was an useful upgrade to ground troops.","K2 Automatic Gun, There is not realy a whole lot about this gun it was only used for about 3 years and could not find many looks a lot like the K3MG crossed with the Micro HMM.","K3 Heavy Machine Gun, this gun is heavy but its not quite a heavy machine gun yet despite its name it only ways about 30 or so pounds it is a gun meant to mow down living things.","K3 Machine gun, It is a burst fire version of the K3HMG and only ways about 20 pounds fires in 3 round burst.","Special Forces Machine Gun, It is also called Ripper it is heavy weighing at 87.6 pounds th reason why it got the nickname Ripper Is because these can rip through armor like nothing.","Kyle Handgun, it is somehow alive dont know how but it gives of the brain waves of a sleeping Kylesorisan maybe it can be woke up who knows overall though its a good gun.","K3 Pistol, Handguns are not a strong suit of Kybins so the fact it does what it was made to is amazing.","Special Forces Pistol,It is also called 1s Death Special or 123 CLEAR due to the fact that a well trained person can clear a room full of peaple in a few seconds.","K3 Auto Sniper Rifle, this rifle is a select fire sniper rifle that can swich betwean single and full auto.","Big Gun, its the bigest nor the strongest but it went uncontested for a long time.","Micro Hmm Rifle, its like half the Hmm It still shoots a lrge projectile but its literaly a Hmm caled down by about half problay more.","20mm Hmm, This is not a gun its a cannon it actualy shoots a projectile biger then 20mm in the third part of the kyclian war these had just been contracted and holycrap were they monstrous the could tear threw tanks, cars, planes, and anything else less then two miles away and ten ft thick all while waying under onehundred pounds."
